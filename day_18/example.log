In the above example, if you were to draw the memory space after the first 12 bytes have fallen (using . for safe and # for corrupted), it would look like this:

...#...
..#..#.
....#..
...#..#
..#..#.
.#..#..
#.#....

You can take steps up, down, left, or right. After just 12 bytes have corrupted locations in your memory space, the shortest path from the top left corner to the exit would take 22 steps. Here (marked with O) is one such path:

OO.#OOO
.O#OO#O
.OOO#OO
...#OO#
..#OO#.
.#.O#..
#.#OOOO
